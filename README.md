      Hi! Hi! I am a BS Computer Science student while also enrolled in Air Force ROTC. My current plans are to graduate and find full time employment in the Chicago area. I am interested in financial trading, risk management, and network security. I hope one day to use my talents to run an investment company.

My Illinois Institute of Technology experience has been amazing. I joined Alpha Sigma Phi as a Freshman and met some great people. I also was on the Swim Team for 2 years, where I broke 2 records.
